        <h3>My Dream Move</h3>

        <img src="smpier.jpg" alt="Me at the Santa Monica Pier" width="400" height="350" style="float: left; margin-right: 15px;">

        <p>My partner at the time and I enjoyed San Francisco, but had always had our hearts set on moving to Los Angeles since we had 
        first met there. We finally moved in the summer of 2019. Growing up, Los Angeles was also a place I always wanted to live in 
        basically for the fact it looked sunny and warm all of the time which was largely true.</p>
         
        <p>We were able to go do hikes near the Hollywood sign in Runyon Canyon pretty much whenever we wanted as well as try different 
        types of cuisine easily as we were several blocks away from Sunset Blvd.</p> 
        
        <p>My favorite thing to do there was hang out by the ocean, either in Santa Monica or preferably Venice when all of the weird things 
        and shops were out on the boardwalk.</p>
