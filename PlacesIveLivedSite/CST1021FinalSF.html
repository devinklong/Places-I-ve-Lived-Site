    <h3 class="sfheader">My First Apartment</h3>

    <p>After I returned from teaching abroad in Bejing for a year, I didn't have any desire to continue with law 
    school. I fortunately had a great potential job opportunity for a company that I interned with twice in 
    college and decided to move to San Francisco where this company was headquartered to interview and get hired.</p>

    <p>It was an incredibly exciting time for me as I moved with my then partner. We found a studio apartment in 
    Palo Alto which felt like a monumental moment since I was officially living somewhere else permanently that 
    wasn't near any of my family or friends at the time. I was nervous at first but excited at the prospect of 
    seeing new things and interacting with different types of people than who I grew up with.</p>

    <p>We lived there for almost 3 years and were able to travel all around the different sections of San Francisco 
    and the area surrounding the city. It was great to always have a new sight to check out the skyline or a 
    serene hiking trail as well as experiencing all kinds of food from different cultures. My favorite memory was 
    being able to see a Golden State Warriors game while they were in the playoffs the year they won an NBA title.</p>
