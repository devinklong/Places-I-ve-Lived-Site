    <h3 class="btonheader">My Hometown</h3>

    <p>Another memorable place I lived in during my childhood and teen years is Bloomington, Minnesota. It's notoriously 
    known for having the world famous Mall of America, although I lived pretty far away from that side of town. I don't 
    really ever recall going there that much unless I was visiting from Canada (RIP to Camp Snoopy, that place ruled).</p>
    
    <p>I moved here when I was about to turn 10 and lived here all the way through high school. I was really 
    happy to move back around the rest of my family since my mom's side are all Minnesotan and as a kid I never 
    remember seeing them that much prior to us moving back.</p>
    
    <p>I played basketball and ran track/cross country when I wasn't in school. For that reason, my personal 
    memorable places where the Jefferson Activities Center where I could get in for free because I went there 
    and Hyland Park due to the running trails there. They were good refuges to work out and burn off some energy 
    and stress.</p>
