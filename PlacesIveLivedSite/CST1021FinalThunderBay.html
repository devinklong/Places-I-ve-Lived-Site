        <h3>My Birthplace</h3>

        <p>Thunder Bay was the city that I was born in. Although I only lived there until I was 5, it still remains
        a very memorable place to me. It's a great city for outdoors types as there are lots of trails, some of which 
        span over 20 km. It's also interesting because it came from combining two cities from early settlements in 
        Port Arthur and Fort William.</p>
        
        <p>Fort William has a really cool and interactive Ojibwa First Nation themed historical site andPort Arthur was 
        a more British settlement initially as it was used as a shipping port given how large Lake Superior is.</p> 
        
        <p>I remember my hiking and camping trips when I visit, but also the large amounts of snow if its winter. 
        For that reason, I'd strongly recommend visiting the summertime since the city mixed with the Canadian 
        wilderness is great.</p>
