    <p>I was looking through all of my photos since I returned to Minnesota and thought I should do a website or 
    project putting some of them together. I moved around a lot as a kid and throughout my adulthood and feel pretty
    fortunate to be able to travel and experience different areas and cultures. </p>
    
    <p>A common positive theme in a lot of these is I've enjoyed being close to bodies of water, 
    whether it's next to the Pacific Ocean or a suburban lake. Here are some of the favorite cities 
    I have lived in for approximately one year or longer.</p>
