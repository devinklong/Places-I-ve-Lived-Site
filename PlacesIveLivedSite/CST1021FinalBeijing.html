        <h3>My Life Abroad</h3>

        <p>After I finished college the first time at the University of Iowa, I had initially planned to go to law school, 
        but wanted to take a break so I filled that year in by teaching kindergarten abroad in Beijing. I wanted to 
        travel somewhere on my own for a longer period of time than before.</p> 
        
        <p>It was one of the most challenging, yet accomplished thing I've done with my life It forced me out of my comfort zone 
        in every way imaginable and through that I made lifelong friendships and became a more confident person.</p> 
        
        <p>I loved Beijing because it had a perfect mixture of modern and old architecture. There were tons of old temples and palaces 
        you could visit. I was fortunate to be able to teach at an inner city school and enjoyed my daily communte on the subway from the east 
        into the heart of the city.</p>
