# Places-I-ve-Lived-Site
This was my first full website created as a project for class I wanted to include in my Portfolio. It displays the top five places I have had the privilege of living in and my favorite memories from each. 
It is a relatively simple design of an index + the 5 places. I included links to various favorite places, a vertical nav bar, a table, a few lists, and pictures I still had. I had the project idea cleaning out
digital photos and thought I could make them useful in some capacity.
